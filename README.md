#neogeek/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

It is a clone of [@holman's feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback) and seems like a pretty fantastic idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

##Ask a Question

To get started you can either [create a new issue](issues/new) or [peruse existings issues](issues/). Issues that are closed have been answered but by no means does that indicate the discussion is over! I'll do my best to answer questions in a timely fashion.

##Twitter

If you have a question that you think would be better suited for 140 characters, hit me up on Twitter [@neogeek](http://twitter.com/@neogeek).
